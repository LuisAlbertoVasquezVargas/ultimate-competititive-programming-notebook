## fastPow
<!-- TODO(luisvasquez) : to add definition-->
### tips
-Name it as fastPow, don't use pow in order to not collide with the builtin-function pow.
-Dont use recursive version, that can lead to stack-overflow.

## Sieve
### Classic Sieve
 With eratosthenes's sieve we can see if a number is a prime (primality test) and also to factorize it.

### Extended Sieve
-An extended version of eratosthenes's sieve which allows factorization of integer numbers.
