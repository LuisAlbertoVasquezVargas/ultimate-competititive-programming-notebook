# Math - Guidelines
## Fast Pow
<!-- TODO(luisvasquez) : to add definition-->
### Tips
- Name it as fastPow, don't use pow in order to not collide with the builtin-function pow.
- Dont use recursive version, that can lead to stack-overflow.

## Primality
<!-- TODO(luisvasquez): test this version, improve their code.-->

## Sieve
### Classic Sieve
- With eratosthenes's sieve we can see if a number is a prime (primality test) and also to factorize it.

### Extended Sieve
- An extended version of eratosthenes's sieve which allows factorization of integer numbers.
